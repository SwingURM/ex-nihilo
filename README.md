# Ex-Nihilo 1.7.10

## Project Status

This is the original 1.7.10 version of Ex-Nihilo. A major refactoring is underway to port modern features from [Ex-Deorum](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/ExDeorum) (1.20.1) back to 1.7.10 for the GT New Horizons ecosystem.

## History

Forked from [this repo](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/ex-nihilo), which forked from the original Ex-Nihilo on [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/RedRockFowl/ex-nihilo/src/master/) and [decompiled 1.38-53](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ex-nihilo).

### Credits

- **Sieve drop-on-break functionality**: Heavily inspired by [Cleptomania/ex-nihilo](https://github.com/Cleptomania/ex-nihilo)
